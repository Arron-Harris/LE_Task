Help Acme Corp to help make a data-driven decision about what compensation scheme to implement in new plants. The spreadsheet came from the manager of one of Acme’s existing plants. The manager that sent it provided the following details:  • The data cover one year (50 weeks of operation) at the plant.  • This plant produces only one product – electrodes.  • The plant was opened at the beginning of the year (week 1).  • Each person’s individual electrode output is measured separately. “Output” (column C of the “All Data” tab of the spreadsheet) is the number of electrodes the person produced during the week.  • Initially, workers were paid a fixed salary equal to 25 currency units per hour. The standard work week is forty hours and there is no overtime work, so all workers had pay of 1000 units per week.  • In the second half of the year (starting in week 26), compensation switched to a piece rate with a guaranteed minimum of 875 currency units per week. Each employee was paid the greater of 875 or 1(electrode output) for the week. So, if a person produced 1100 electrodes, he/she earned 1100 (because this is greater than 875). If a person produced 800 electrodes, he/she earned 875 (because 1800=800 is less than the guaranteed minimum of 875)
